V ERI -S URE: Multi-Agent Framework for Correct RTL Code

Appendices We supplement some additional technical content here in the
appendices. Specifically, Appendix A presents additional details of the
V ERILOG E VAL - V 2-EXT benchmark; Appendix B documents implementation
details of the V ERI -S URE framework; Appendix C reports three case
studies; and Appendix D offers a detailed comparison with other related
frameworks.

A. The V ERILOG E VAL - V 2-EXT Benchmark This appendix provides
additional details for V ERILOG E VAL - V 2-EXT, including (i) a full
taxonomy and coverage analysis of the original VerilogEval-v2 tasks,
(ii) the motivations and design targets of our 53 newly added
industrial-grade tasks, and (iii) the rule-based difficulty grading
scheme used in the paper.

A.1. Summary of Existing Problems The original VerilogEval-v2 benchmark
contains 156 RTL code generation tasks. While it offers a strong
coverage of basic digital logic problems, we find it under-represents
the types of modules that dominate real RTL development, such as
protocol controllers, buffering, and multi-cycle datapaths. As a result,
models can achieve high scores by mastering local syntax patterns and
short combinational reasoning, while still failing on
engineering-critical behaviors like latency alignment, corner-case
handling, and stateful control logic. To make this limitation explicit
and to identify concrete coverage gaps, we manually reviewed all 156
problems and grouped them into nine categories, summarized in Table 3.

Taxonomy Methodology Each problem is assigned to the category that most
strongly determines its implementation structure (e.g., whether the
solution is dominated by combinational datapath wiring, sequential state
machines, or algorithmic transformations). When a problem touches
multiple concepts, we classify it by the dominant design pattern
required to pass the golden testbench.

Table 3. Full taxonomy of the original VerilogEval-v2 benchmark. We
group problems into nine categories to reveal coverage biases and
industrial blind spots.

V ERI -S URE: Multi-Agent Framework for Correct RTL Code

Key Observations and Limitations This taxonomy highlights why
simulation-only pass rates on VerilogEval-v2 can overestimate progress
toward silicon-grade RTL code generation:

• Over-emphasis on short, textbook patterns: A large fraction of tasks
are small-scale logic exercises (Categories I--III) or repetitive FSM
variants (Category VIII).

• Severe under-coverage of industrial datapaths: "Basic Arithmetic"
comprises only 9/156 tasks, largely limited to simple integer
operations.

• Missing protocol and buffering semantics: The original set does not
systematically test standard communication protocols (UART/SPI/I2 C) or
ubiquitous flow-control primitives (FIFOs, skid buffers).

• Limited exposure to CDC and multi-clock assumptions: Most tasks assume
a single clock domain, ignoring reset-domain reasoning and CDC safety.

A.2. New Problems To address the coverage gaps above, we introduce V
ERILOG E VAL - V 2-EXT by adding 53 new industrial-grade tasks, bringing
the total to 209 problems. The new problems are designed to be
industry-aligned, specifically targeting multi-cycle behaviors and
synthesizable constructs. We aim cover the missing areas detailed in
Table 4

Table 4. Classifications of the 53 new tasks in V ERILOG E VAL - V
2-EXT. The categories are chosen to reflect common IP/SoC RTL
development patterns that are sparse or absent in the original
VerilogEval-v2 benchmark.

A.3. Grading Scheme To enable a more fine-grained analysis, we stratify

complexity score computed from the canonical RTL implementation. The
complexity of hardware description language (HDL) code can be
systematically decomposed into three orthogonal dimensions: (i)
structural complexity, which is measured by the number of code lines
(LOC) to reflect the scale and modularity of the design; (ii) data
complexity, usually reflected by the bit width for processing data to
indicate numerical precision and storage requirements; and (iii)
temporal complexity, which is characterized by the diversity of temporal
structures and nesting depth to represent the complexity of temporal
logic such as clock domains, state machines, and pipelines. These three
dimensions jointly determine the difficulty of understanding,
implementing, and verifying the design. During the construction process,
these three dimensions are scored, with structural complexity mapped to
the macroscopic indicator of lines of code (LOC); data complexity is
mainly represented by the maximum bit width (Max Width); and timing
complexity is jointly characterized by the complexity of assignment
statements (#assign), the number of blocks (#always), and conditional
branches (#case) among other syntactic elements. Therefore, the
complexity score S is the sum of sub-scores derived from five metrics:

                                       S = sloc + sassign + salways + scase + swidth                                                (5)

                                                                13

The scoring rules are detailed in Table 5. We map the total score S to
difficulty labels:

                               Easy : S ≤ 1         Medium : 2 ≤ S ≤ 3              Hard : S ≥ 4.

label for each problem. We then did a manual review of the resulting

A.4. Issues with Prob099 During the construction and revision of our V
ERILOG E VAL - V 2-EXT Benchmark, we have spotted some issues with the
original Prob099 design from VerilogEval-v2 under our Verilator
environment. Specifically, when we attempted to compile and run the
Prob099 harness under Verilator, the build failed during elaboration
with fatal named-port connection errors, so the simulation never started
and no functional comparison could be performed. In the Verilator log,
the failure presents as repeated PINNOTFOUND diagnostics indicating that
the testbench tries to connect ports Y2 and Y4 on both the reference
instance and the DUT instance, even though those formal port names do
not exist on the corresponding module definitions. A representative
excerpt is:

                                                                14

V ERI -S URE: Multi-Agent Framework for Correct RTL Code

1 %Error-PINNOTFOUND: ...Prob099_m2014_q6c_test.sv:74:4: Pin not found:

Pin not found: 'Y4' 5 %Error: Exiting due to 4 error(s)

The root cause is an interface mismatch between the testbench and the
provided reference/DUT module definitions. The reference module
RefModule (and the auto-generated TopModule wrapper used for validation)
exports outputs named Y1 and Y3, but the testbench file instantiates
both modules as if they exported Y2 and Y4. Verilator resolves named
port connections strictly: when it sees an instantiation such as .Y2(Y2
ref), it searches the callee's port list for a formal named Y2; if no
such formal exists, it raises PINNOTFOUND and terminates. Conceptually,
this is consistent with a naming/offset confusion in the problem
statement text: the prompt mentions "Y2 and Y4 corresponding to y\[1\]
and y\[3\]," while the actual reference implementation uses the
convention "Y1 corresponds to the next-state signal for y\[1\] and Y3
corresponds to the next-state signal for y\[3\]." In other words, the
authoritative artifacts (reference module + wrapper) define Y1/Y3, but
the testbench was written against the inconsistent Y2/Y4 naming. To fix
the issue, we made the testbench consistent with the reference/DUT
interface and with the benchmark's intended observation points. We
renamed the internal signals and updated the named port connections in
both instantiations accordingly. We also aligned the testbench's
declaration of the state vector to the canonical module interface by
changing it from a 1-based range (logic \[6:1\] y) to the conventional
0-based range (logic \[5:0\] y) in both the stimulus generator and the
top-level testbench. After these changes, Verilator is able to compile
the testbench successfully and execute the simulation, and the DUT (when
wrapped to mirror the reference) produces matching Y1 and Y3 outputs
over the randomized one-hot stimulus set.

B. V ERI -S URE: Additional Implementation Details This appendix
documents additional implementation-level details of V ERI -S URE that
are omitted from the main paper for clarity, including the design
contract schema, linting rules, static dependency graph construction for
localization, trace alignment/slicing for temporal debugging, and formal
miter generation for Boolean equivalence checking.

B.1. Contract Schema As described in subsection 5.1, each benchmark task
provides a fixed module interface and an executable testbench.
Nevertheless, the intent behind cycle-accurate behaviors (reset
conventions, sampling edge, output latency, corner cases) is frequently
under-specified in natural language and can drift across iterations or
agent handoffs. V ERI -S URE addresses this by introducing a design
contract as a structured intermediate representation (IR) shared across
agents.

Required Fields In our implementation, the contract is a JSON object
with five required top-level sections:

     • module name: (string) The top-level DUT module identifier.

     • io: (list) An ordered list of port objects. Each port entry contains:
         – name: (string) Signal identifier (SystemVerilog identifier constraints).
         – dir: (string) One of {input, output, inout}.
         – width: (int) Positive integer bit-width (scalars use 1).
         – description: (string) Natural-language semantic summary.

     • clocking: (object) Global clock/reset semantics:
         – clock.name: clock signal name (must appear in io).
         – clock.edge: posedge or negedge.
         – reset.name: reset signal name (must appear in io).
         – reset.active: high or low.

                                                             15

V ERI -S URE: Multi-Agent Framework for Correct RTL Code

       – reset.kind: sync or async.

• timing: (object) A mapping from each output to its expected latency,
in cycles, relative to contract-defined sampling: --
timing.outputs\[signal\].latency cycles: (int) non-negative; 0 denotes
combinational-by- contract.

• functional summary: (object) A compact functional description used to
ground verification, including Boolean/combinational obligations: --
Typically contains a high-level overview plus a machine-readable list of
rules describing input/output relations and corner cases.

Optional Fields To support richer tasks, the implementation also allows
optional keys (ignored if absent), such as parameters (typed module
parameters), and test plan (directed stimulus/check intent).

Schema Usage The same contract instance is injected into: (i) the Coder
prompt (to enforce interface/timing consistency), (ii) the Verifier
prompt (to generate a self-checking testbench consistent with the
contract), (iii) the Asserter prompt (to generate temporal assertions
for the clock/reset/latency obligations), and (iv) the Boolean Proofer
(to extract combinational obligations for formal equivalence when
applicable).

B.2. Contract Linting To prevent malformed or hallucinated contracts
from propagating into RTL code generation and verification, V ERI -S URE
applies a straightforward linter to every Architect-produced JSON before
invoking downstream agents.

Linting Objectives The linter enforces three classes of constraints:

1.  Schema validity (structure and typing): The linter checks presence
    of required keys (module name, io, clocking, timing, functional
    summary), validates that types are correct (e.g., width and latency
    cycles are integers), and rejects contracts with invalid
    enumerations (e.g., dir not in {input,output,inout}).

2.  Signal consistency and referential integrity: The linter
    ensures: (i) all port names are unique, (ii) all names match
    SystemVerilog identifier rules (no whitespace, no illegal
    characters), (iii) all signals referenced by clocking and
    timing.outputs exist in io, and (iv) widths are positive (scalar
    normalized to 1).

3.  Clock/reset integrity and canonicalization: Sequential semantics
    depend on consistent clock/reset conventions. If the contract
    indicates sequential behavior, the linter verifies that clock/reset
    are present in io. When the Architect omits clocking but the port
    list contains standard names (e.g., clk, rst, rst n), the linter
    infers missing clock/reset entries and makes these assumptions
    explicit in the canonicalized contract.

Canonicalization In addition to validation, the linter normalizes
contracts to a canonical form to reduce downstream ambiguity:

• normalizes scalar widths to 1;

• ensures timing.outputs exists for all outputs (defaulting missing
entries to latency cycles = 0 unless otherwise implied);

• preserves the io order (important for consistent rendering and
debugging reports), while enabling fast name-to-port lookup via an
internal dictionary.

If linting fails, V ERI -S URE does not attempt generation; instead the
Architect is re-invoked with the lint error report to fix the contract.

                                                               16

V ERI -S URE: Multi-Agent Framework for Correct RTL Code

B.3. Static Dependency Graph Construction V ERI -S URE localizes repairs
using a static dependency slice over the RTL source (subsection 3.3).
This slice is computed from a dependency graph built directly from the
SystemVerilog AST, rather than fragile regex matching.

Parsing Frontend We use tree-sitter-verilog to parse the generated RTL
into an AST and extract semantic units. This provides stable node spans
(start/end line ranges) required by our block-level patching mechanism.

Block Granularity The RTL is decomposed into atomic RtlBlock units. A
block is any semantic unit that can drive signals:

• Procedural blocks: always/always comb/always ff/always latch.

• Continuous assignments: assign statements.

• Submodule instances: treated as blocks to account for hierarchical
wiring when present.

Each block stores a unique identifier, its source span (line range), its
raw text, and statically extracted read/write sets.

Read/Write Extraction For each block B, we compute:

• W (B) (write set): all L-values written by the block (e.g., left-hand
sides of = or \<=, including bit/part selects mapped to their base
identifiers).

• R(B) (read set): all identifiers used as R-values in RHS expressions
and control predicates (e.g., if conditions, case selectors), as well as
explicit sensitivity list identifiers when present.

For module instances, W (B) and R(B) are inferred from the port
connections when directionality is unambiguous; otherwise, the instance
is conservatively treated as reading all connected signals, and writing
those connected to nets whose names match the instance's output
connections in the AST.

Driver Map and Dependency Relation We build a global driver map:

                                                 D(s) = { B | s ∈ W (B) },                                                     (6)

which maps each signal s to the set of blocks that may drive it. A
directed dependency edge exists from Bi to Bj iff Bj reads a signal
written by Bi : Bj ← Bi ⇔ W (Bi ) ∩ R(Bj ) ̸= ∅, (7)

Backward Depedency Slicing Given a failing output set Yfail identified
by simulation/trace analysis, we compute the suspect block set Bsus
using a bounded backward BFS: \[ B0 = D(y), (8) y∈Yfail \[ \[ Bd+1 = Bd
∪ D(r), (9) B∈Bd r∈R(B)

and finally Bsus = Bdmax . We use a small fixed depth bound dmax to
balance localization precision and completeness: deeper slices increase
recall but also inflate the Debugger context window, which can reduce
the precision of LLM-guided patches. The resulting Bsus is then used to
enforce edit locality: the Debugger is only allowed to modify blocks
within Bsus , while all other lines are preserved verbatim, reducing
regressions and "repair hallucinations".

                                                                  17

V ERI -S URE: Multi-Agent Framework for Correct RTL Code

B.4. Trace Alignment & Slicing Simulation feedback is often too coarse
(pass/fail or a single mismatch) to support reliable multi-cycle
repairs. V ERI -S URE therefore converts raw simulation artifacts into
an LLM-consumable trace report that localizes failures in both time and
signal space.

Failure Localization The Verilator harness captures stdout/stderr and
parses for the earliest failure event, including assertion failures
emitted by the Asserter or explicit mismatch diagnostics (e.g.,
"Mismatch at time . . ."). This produces the first failing timestamp tf
(or equivalently a failure cycle index under the contract-defined
sampling scheme).

Windowed Waveform Extraction We extract a short window ending at the
failure:

                                                W(tf ; K) = [tf − K · Tclk , tf ],                                           (10)

where Tclk is the clock period inferred from the testbench and K is a
small constant (typically K=8 cycles). Using a VCD parser, we sample
signal values at the contract-specified clock edge (posedge or negedge)
and record:

1.  the failing output signals Yfail (and their expected values when
    available),

2.  all top-level inputs (for context),

3.  internal state signals identified by the static slice (signals
    appearing in R(B) or W (B) for B ∈ Bsus ).

To keep reports compact, wide vectors are formatted in hexadecimal when
possible, and stable signals may be elided if they do not change
throughout the window.

Alignment Diagnosis for off-by-one Timing Bugs Pipeline and handshake
designs frequently fail due to a one-cycle latency mismatch or
sampling-edge errors. To provide actionable timing hints, the tracing
mechanism performs a lightweight alignment check by testing small cycle
shifts δ ∈ {−2, −1, 0, +1, +2} between observed and expected outputs and
computing a mismatch score: X score(δ) = I\[ODUT (t) ̸= Oexp (t + δ)\] .
(11) t∈W

If arg minδ score(δ) occurs at δ ̸= 0 with a significant score
reduction, the report emits an explicit hint (e.g., "best alignment at
δ= + 1: output appears 1 cycle late"). This signal is complementary to
assertion failures generated by the Asserter and is particularly
effective for diagnosing systematic latency shifts that may not be
obvious from single-cycle mismatches.

Trace Report Format The final trace report includes: (i) the failure
cycle/time, (ii) the set of failing outputs, (iii) the best alignment
hint (if any), and (iv) the windowed trace slice. This report is
injected into the Debugger prompt together with the localized suspect
blocks Bsus , enabling the Debugger to propose minimal edits grounded in
concrete temporal evidence.

B.5. Formal Miter Construction The Boolean Proofer targets purely
combinational logics by proving equivalence between (i) the DUT
implementation and (ii) a compact specification model synthesized from
the contract. This is implemented using an automatically generated
miter.

Selecting Targets of Proof From the contract timing map, we identify
candidate combinational outputs:

                                  Ycomb = { y ∈ Outputs | latency cycles(y) = 0 }.                                           (12)

To avoid unsound proofs on stateful logic, we further filter Ycomb by
dependency analysis: any output driven by an always ff (or a clocked
always) in the current RTL is excluded from combinational proving. This
conservative rule ensures the miter remains purely combinational.

                                                               18

V ERI -S URE: Multi-Agent Framework for Correct RTL Code

Model Synthesis and Wrapping We compile functional summary into a
synthesizable SystemVerilog specification module that computes each
yspec in Ycomb from the shared inputs x. For simple Boolean expressions,
this is emitted as assign statements; for piecewise logic, it is emitted
as always comb with if/case. We generate then a wrapper that
instantiates the DUT and module in parallel, ties their inputs, and
asserts equality on selected outputs. A simplified schematic is like:

        Example

1 module Miter(/\* shared inputs */); 2 // shared inputs: declared here
3 // dut/spec outputs 4 logic \[W-1:0\] y_dut, y_spec; 5 6 dut_top dut
(/* .a(a), .b(b), ... */, .y(y_dut)); 7 SpecModule spec (/* .a(a),
.b(b), ... \*/, .y(y_spec)); 8 9 always @* begin 10 assert (y_dut ==
y_spec); 11 end 12 endmodule

Running SymbiYosys The DUT, specification module, and Miter are passed
to SymbiYosys using an SMT-based proving flow (Z3 backend in our setup).
Since the miter is combinational, the proof reduces to a SAT/SMT
validity query over ∀x. If the proof fails, sby produces a
counterexample assignment x⋆ ; we parse this model and translate it into
a concrete input vector (and, when applicable, a directed stimulus
snippet) that is fed back to the Debugger. This provides a precise,
minimal witness of the Boolean mismatch and helps disambiguate pure
logic faults from timing/latency faults already handled by the trace and
assertion branches.

C. Case Studies C.1. Case Study 1: Boolean Proofer for an 8-bit Signed
Multiplier This case study evaluates the effectiveness of the Boolean
Proofer on an 8-bit parallel multiplier (Prob157) designed using
two's-complement arithmetic. The objective is to implement a purely
combinational multiplier that calculates the product of two 8-bit signed
integers, a and b, by summing eight sign-extended and shifted 16-bit
partial products. This corresponds to the first case in Figure 5.

Problem Description Initially, a candidate implementation was tested
against the formal specification. During Boolean equivalence checking,
the proofer identified a fundamental mismatch between the implementation
logic and the mathematical specification of signed multiplication.

Formal Specification and Counterexample The Boolean Proofer identified
that the implementation treated the multiplier b as an unsigned value,
failing to account for the negative weight of the Most Significant Bit
(MSB). The logical divergence is summarized below:

Root Cause identification The error stemmed from a common misconception
in signed arithmetic. In a two's-complement multiplier, the MSB of the
multiplier, b\[7\], carries a negative weight (−27 ).

1.  Unsigned Weight Assumption: The original logic treated all bits of b
    as positive weights, effectively calculating A × Bunsigned .

2.  Partial Product Sign Error: For a correct signed product, the 8th
    partial product must be subtracted (or added as a two's-complement
    negation) to account for the negative weight: 6 X P roduct = (b\[i\]
    · (a ≪ i)) − (b\[7\] · (a ≪ 7)) i=0

Code Patching Following the feedback from the Boolean Proofer, the
Verilog implementation was refined. The logic for generating the 8th
partial product was adjusted to handle the negative weight of the sign
bit as shown in Listing 1.

The correction ensures that the last stage of the Wallace tree or adder
array performs a subtraction for the MSB partial product. The fix was
validated using an exhaustive formal check, confirming that the
implementation's logical functions perfectly matched the mathematical
specification across all input spaces.

C.2. Case Study 2: Assertion Violation in Global History Register This
case study examines a timing violation detected during the formal
verification of Pro118, involving improper state updates in the Global
History (GH) register logic. The violation stems from a signal
transition occurring on the negative edge of the clock, thereby
breaching the synchronous design principle. This corresponds to the
second case in Figure 5.

Problem Description During assertion-based verification, the monitor
flagged a violation of the NO NEGEDGE UPDATE property. This assertion
enforces that the signal predict history must remain stable during the
negative edge of the clock (negedge clk), as any update at this phase
indicates either asynchronous behavior or combinational leakage into the
sequential domain.

Formal Property and Counterexample The verification environment employs
an Assertion-Based Verification monitor with the following assertion
shown in Listing 2 A counterexample was generated by the formal solver
at simulation cycle t = 30 , where predict history changed from 0x01 to
0x03 precisely on negedge clk. This illegal transition suggests the
presence of either a combinational path influencing the output or an
asynchronous reset hazard coinciding with the assertion's sampling
window.

Root Cause Identification Two flaws were identified in the original RTL
implementation:

    1. Implicit Latch Risk: The sequential logic relied on implicit state retention (i.e., missing else clauses or default
       assignments). Under certain synthesis or formal analysis conditions, particularly during reset recovery, this can manifest
       as non-deterministic latch-like behavior.
    2. Reset-to-Output Combinational Path: The continuous assignment assign predict history = GH; created
       a transparent combinational path from the internal register GH to the observed output. When the asynchronous reset
       signal areset de-asserts asynchronously relative to clk, a transient glitch on predict history may occur
       exactly during the negedge clk sampling instant, triggering the assertion failure.

Code Patching To eliminate the violation, the design was refactored to
enforce explicit state preservation and isolate asynchronous reset
effects from the observation point. The revised implementation uses a
fully specified always ff block with synchronous reset semantics and
masks combinational glitches via a ternary operator as shown in Listing
3.

    endmodule

The correction ensures that predict history is driven only by a
registered value (GH) when not in reset, and forced to zero during
reset, thereby eliminating any race between asynchronous reset release
and clock edges. The fix was validated using a Formal Equivalence Check
, confirming functional equivalence while satisfying the NO NEGEDGE
UPDATE assertion across all reachable states.

C.3. Case Study 3: Automated Repair of Shift Direction Mismatch This
case study illustrates a common logical discrepancy between intended
Register-Transfer Level (RTL) behavior and the actual implementation
within a multi-functional sequential circuit in Prob063. The target
design is a 4-bit register integrating two primary operations: (i) a
left-shift with serial input data, and (ii) a modulo-16 decrement
counter.

Problem Description A functional mismatch was identified when both
control signals, shift ena and count ena, were asserted. Per the
specification, shift ena has higher priority; therefore, the register
must perform a left shift regardless of count ena.

Trace Analysis & Localization The failure was captured at simulation
timestamp t = 370 ns. Inputs are sampled at negedge clk and the register
updates at the subsequent posedge clk. The trace log (summarized in
Table 6) records the pre-state q(t) at the sampling edge and the
observed/expected next-state values at the following update edge. As
shown in the trace, the design is in state q(t)=4'b1100 with shift ena=1
and data=0. Under the required left-shift specification, the next state
must be {q\[2:0\], data} = {100, 0} = 4'b1000. However, the DUT pro-
duces 4'b0110, which corresponds to a right-shift style concatenation
{data, q\[3:1\]}. The automated debugger localized the failure to the
shift transition logic via trace-driven temporal diagnosis, highlighting
a bit-ordering error in the concatenation. Table 6. Failing transaction
captured at t = 370 ns (inputs sampled at negedge clk; next state
observed at the following posedge clk).

Root Cause Identification The localization tool identified the suspect
logic within the always ff block. Inspection of the RTL source confirms
a directional implementation error: the design specification requires a
left shift, but the implementation used a right-shift concatenation,
placing data at the MSB rather than the LSB.

Code Patching To resolve the discrepancy, the framework applied a
localized patch that re-orders the concatenation to match the left-shift
specification (placing data at the LSB), as shown in Listing 4.

Subsequent re-simulation confirmed that the revised logic matches the
golden model for all exercised traces, including cases where shift ena
and count ena are simultaneously asserted. By using localized patching
instead of full-file regeneration, the framework eliminated the mismatch
while preserving the stability of the remaining logic.
